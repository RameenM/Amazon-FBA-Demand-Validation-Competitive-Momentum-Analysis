# Amazon FBA Demand Validation and Competitive Momentum Analysis

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the demand and competitive momentum of an Amazon FBA product to assess whether it is suitable for small-batch testing or scalable investment. At this stage, the analysis deliberately excludes profitability, cost structure, advertising efficiency, and margin calculations. Instead, it focuses on demand validation by examining sales stability, momentum, and competitive behavior.

The analytical framework is designed to support repeatable evaluation of future product opportunities using transparent, pattern-based analysis rather than isolated screenshots or intuition-driven decisions.

## Product Context

- **Product:** VORA 2-Tier Spice Organizer for Cabinets  
- **ASIN:** B0DK724BZP  
- **Data Source:** Helium 10 (third-party estimates)

---

## Product Selection Logic

The product was selected based on a moderate review count of approximately 200 reviews rather than products with extremely high review volumes. Products with very high review counts typically indicate:

- Fully established demand  
- Strong seller dominance  
- Outcomes driven primarily by brand trust and historical performance  

In such cases, opportunities for testing, learning, or strategic differentiation are limited.

In contrast, products with lower but non-trivial review counts exhibit observable demand while remaining analytically informative. Sales patterns, ranking movement, and competitive shifts remain visible, allowing for clearer assessment of whether demand is emerging, stabilizing, or declining. This context is more suitable for small-batch testing and incremental scaling decisions.

Prior to analysis, additional validation checks confirmed that:

- Product ratings were positive  
- ASIN-level sales were increasing  
- Parent-level category sales were also trending upward  

Rising ASIN sales indicate preference for the specific product variant, while parent-level growth suggests expanding interest in the broader product category.

## Data Sources and Analytical Use

### Sales Estimation Data

Sales estimation data was obtained from Helium 10 and Alibaba and includes estimated daily units sold, listing price, and derived revenue values. Approximately 30 days of daily data were analyzed. These estimates are not treated as precise measurements but are used to identify behavioral patterns such as consistency of purchases, directional demand trends, volatility, and potential price sensitivity.

### Best Seller Rank (BSR) Data

BSR data provides a relative measure of product performance within its competitive environment. Between 30 and 90 days of BSR data were used to evaluate whether sales activity translated into improved competitive positioning or whether gains were absorbed by increased competition. While BSR does not indicate unit volume directly, it serves as a validation mechanism for demand persistence over time.

---

## Focus on Subcategory BSR

The analysis prioritizes subcategory BSR rather than primary category BSR. Primary category rankings aggregate a broad and heterogeneous set of products, resulting in slower movement and reduced sensitivity to short-term demand changes. Subcategory BSR compares more similar products, responds more quickly to sales fluctuations, and provides clearer early signals of momentum.

Primary BSR was reviewed for context but excluded from the main visuals to maintain analytical focus on actionable demand indicators.

## Visual Analysis Overview (Evidence-Based Interpretation)

### Daily Units Sold Trend

The daily units sold visualization shows a clear upward shift in baseline demand over time. Early observations cluster in the low-to-mid teens, while later values consistently reach the high teens and low twenties, with multiple peaks approaching or exceeding 25 units per day. Despite normal daily volatility, there are no extended low-demand periods, indicating repeatable and sustained demand rather than isolated spikes.

---

### Estimated Revenue Trend

Estimated revenue increases alongside unit sales and does not exhibit prolonged flat or declining periods. The alignment between rising unit volume and rising revenue indicates that sales growth is not driven solely by aggressive price discounting, reinforcing the conclusion that demand growth is economically meaningful.

---

### Price vs. Units Sold

The price-versus-units analysis shows higher unit sales during periods of price reduction, confirming some degree of price sensitivity. However, unit sales do not collapse when prices rise, and baseline demand remains present across the full period. This suggests that demand is influenced by price but not entirely dependent on discounts.

---

### Weekly Subcategory BSR Trend

The subcategory BSR trend fluctuates between approximately the 2,000 and 6,000 rank range. Periods of ranking improvement are followed by deterioration, indicating increasing competitive pressure. This demonstrates that while the product can sell, competitive forces remain active and dynamic.

---

### Sales and BSR Momentum Alignment

When weekly sales totals are aligned with weekly subcategory BSR, higher sales do not consistently translate into improved rankings. Weeks with strong unit sales sometimes coincide with stagnant or worsening BSR positions. This divergence highlights the structural difference between the two metrics:

- Sales estimation reflects absolute demand for the product  
- BSR reflects relative performance against competitors  

The lack of one-to-one alignment indicates that competitive activity absorbs part of the demand growth rather than demand being absent.

---

### 7-Day Rolling Average Demand

Applying a seven-day rolling average reduces daily volatility and reveals a sustained demand level that remains elevated throughout the observed period. The smoothed trend does not revert to early-period lows, supporting the interpretation that demand growth is structural rather than noise-driven.

---

### Average Daily Demand (Last 14 Days)

The final validation metric shows an average daily demand of **19 units sold** over the most recent 14-day period. This value is materially higher than early-period averages and confirms that demand remains active in the current period. The metric serves as a decision checkpoint by translating historical trends into a clear, current indicator of demand stability.

---

## Integrated Interpretation

Taken together, the sales estimation visuals establish that demand is consistent, repeatable, and sustained at a higher baseline than earlier periods. In contrast, the BSR visuals demonstrate that competitive pressure limits how fully this demand converts into ranking improvements. The divergence between strong sales patterns and inconsistent BSR gains explains why the product demonstrates momentum but remains constrained by market competition.

---

## Conclusion

The combined evidence indicates that the product demonstrates real and repeatable demand supported by stable recent sales and sustained performance after smoothing. Competitive pressure is present and increasing, but it does not eliminate demand momentum.

Based on these findings, the product is suitable for small-batch inventory testing, particularly for new or risk-conscious FBA sellers seeking to validate demand before committing significant capital.

## Limitations

- Sales and revenue figures are based on third-party estimates rather than audited transaction data  
- The analysis focuses on a single product and a limited time window  
- Longer-term seasonality and structural market shifts may not be captured  
- Advertising activity, inventory constraints, and external market factors are not explicitly modeled  
- Findings support directional decision-making rather than precise forecasting or guaranteed outcomes
